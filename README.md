# Ungamify
As you might know most of the software these days employ at least one kind of Gamification technique to make the users addicted to their experience and making the users return. While Gamification might be good at some cases it's not always good.

I personally used to do a lot of open source projects and commit as much as I could to have a huge GitHub contribution. This task was anything but good for me. I did a lot of free things while I could do other stuff and have a good salary or revenue. When I studied my behaviors, I found out that I'm highly addicted to these gamification stuff.

Ungamify is a simple collection of _[WebExtension Content Scripts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Content_scripts)_ that are developed for specific websites to remove their Gamifications.

I hope you fork this and add the Gamifications of the websites you find bad for your health too. Hope it makes your life a little bit better.
